sym-\/ildl is a C++ package for producing fast incomplete factorizations of symmetric indefinite matrices. Given an n x n symmetric indefinite matrix A, this package produces an incomplete L\+DL\textquotesingle{} factorization. To improve stability, the matrix is equilibriated in the max-\/norm and preordered using the Reverse Cuthill-\/\+Mc\+Kee algorithm prior to factorization. To maintain stability, we use Bunch-\/\+Kaufman partial pivoting during the factorization process.
